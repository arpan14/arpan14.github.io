      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hi All ! My name is Arpan. I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer at Amazon. I did my undergraduation at the Manipal Institute of Technology - Manipal graduating with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I came to college with absolutely no experience in programming/coding and built this skill by participating in coding contests hosted on Codechef and Codeforces. Towards the later half of college, I participated in a lot of hackathons and made some open source contributions at Github.</description>
