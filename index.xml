      <description>Hi All ! My name is Arpan. I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer at Amazon. I did my undergraduation at the Manipal Institute of Technology - Manipal graduating with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I came to college with absolutely no experience in programming/coding and built this skill by participating in coding contests hosted on Codechef and Codeforces. Towards the later half of college, I participated in a lot of hackathons and made some open source contributions at Github.</description>
